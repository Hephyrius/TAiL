//TAiL is a dApp and Library created for the Tron Accelerator
//The Python library enables training of Neural Network Classifiers
//As well as the export of trained models in JSON Form
//The smart contract allows pretrained models to be used on the TVM
//By allowing users to initialise them via a smart contract deployer system
//The ReactJs front end allows the deployment, initialisation and use of the Neural Networks
//It also allows the exploration of the Neural Networks by allowing users to see Past Predictions
//As Well as Owners and Deployed Addresses.
